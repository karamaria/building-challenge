For this task, I replicated the provided wireframe using React, and I also created a bonus page with React Router as requested.  By clicking on any of the links in the navigation bar, users can access the bonus page. The required CSS features (z-index, box-shadow, pseudo-classes, layout using grid and flexbox) were all applied. I also ensured that the margins and padding are consistent across all elements, and the design is mobile-responsive.

There were no major requirements I couldn't achieve, however getting the layout just right and making it align perfectly with the wireframe took a bit more time!!
